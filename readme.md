# üí∞ DigiPay - Digital Wallet System Backend

Welcome to **DigiPay**, a secure, modular, and role-based backend API designed for a digital wallet system inspired by popular platforms like Bkash and Nagad. Built using Express.js and Mongoose, this backend empowers users, agents, and admins to perform wallet management, transactions, and role-based operations with ease and security.

---

## üß≠ Project Overview

DigiPay offers a comprehensive backend solution where:

- Users can register, top-up wallets, withdraw funds, send money, and view their transaction history.
- Agents can perform cash-in and cash-out operations on behalf of users and monitor their commission history.
- Admins have full control over users, agents, wallets, and transactions, including blocking wallets and managing agent statuses.

The system is built with JWT-based authentication, secure password hashing, and a modular architecture following best practices for scalability and maintainability.

## üìå Key Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based login system with three roles: **admin**, **user**, **agent**.
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt.
- Role-based route protection to restrict access.

### Wallet Management

- Automatic wallet creation for users and agents during registration.
- Initial wallet balance assigned (e.g., ‡ß≥50).
- Users can top-up, withdraw, and transfer money.
- Agents can cash-in and cash-out money for users.
- Admins can block/unblock wallets and approve/suspend agents.

### Transaction Management

- All transactions (top-up, withdrawal, transfer, cash-in/out) are recorded and traceable.
- Supports transaction history retrieval for users and agents.
- Admins can view all transactions.

### Modular Architecture

- Separate modules for authentication, users, wallets, and transactions.
- Clean folder structure for scalability and ease of development.
